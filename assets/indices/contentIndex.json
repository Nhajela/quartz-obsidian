I was feeling low on energy and low on the will to do anything\n\nBut then he called me and told me that he signed the client that I was needed to manage. This was like an opportunity, call to rise up. \nI'm like, okay, I need to do this and the only way I'm gonna do this is if I take things in my control.\n\nSo, the rest of the day, I've slowly reclaimed control of my mind. \nRight now, before sleeping. I feel much better, normal and hopeful.\n\nWork gives me energy. \n\nI hope to build on this momentum and work to both fix my mental health and do crazy amazing work. \n\nI want to be crazy, I want to obsess and work.\n\nI want to be crazy with the people around me, to tell them that I love them. \n\nMay god be with me, and may I help myself through this journey.\n\n\u003e It is all in your mind, remember that!\n\n\n\nHave a great day ahead!\nNmn\n",

    "title": "Configuration",
    "content": "\r\n## Configuration\r\nQuartz is designed to be extremely configurable. You can find the bulk of the configuration scattered throughout the repository depending on how in-depth you'd like to get.\r\n\r\nThe majority of configuration can be found under `data/config.yaml`. An annotated example configuration is shown below.\r\n\r\n```yaml {title=\"data/config.yaml\"}\r\n# The name to display in the footer\r\nname: Jacky Zhao\r\n\r\n# whether to globally show the table of contents on each page\r\n# this can be turned off on a per-page basis by adding this to the\r\n# front-matter of that note\r\nenableToc: true\r\n\r\n# whether to by-default open or close the table of contents on each page\r\nopenToc: false\r\n\r\n# whether to display on-hover link preview cards\r\nenableLinkPreview: true\r\n\r\n# whether to render titles for code blocks\r\nenableCodeBlockTitle: true \r\n\r\n# whether to render copy buttons for code blocks\r\nenableCodeBlockCopy: true \r\n\r\n# whether to render callouts\r\nenableCallouts: true\r\n\r\n# whether to try to process Latex\r\nenableLatex: true\r\n\r\n# whether to enable single-page-app style rendering\r\n# this prevents flashes of unstyled content and improves\r\n# smoothness of Quartz.

Ensure that code block titles are enabled in Quartz's configuration:\r\n\r\n    ```yaml {title=\"data/config.yaml\", linenos=false}\r\n    enableCodeBlockTitle: true\r\n    ```\r\n\r\n2. Add the `title` attribute to the desired [code block\r\n   fence](https://gohugo.io/content-management/syntax-highlighting/#highlighting-in-code-fences):\r\n\r\n      ```markdown {linenos=false}\r\n       ```yaml {title=\"data/config.yaml\"}\r\n       enableCodeBlockTitle: true  # example from step 1\r\n       ```\r\n      ```\r\n\r\n**Note** that if `{title=\u003cmy-title\u003e}` is included, and code block titles are not\r\nenabled, no errors will occur, and the title attribute will be ignored.\r\n\r\n### HTML Favicons\r\nIf you would like to customize the favicons of your Quartz-based website, you \r\ncan add them to the `data/config.yaml` file. The **default** without any set \r\n`favicon` key is:\r\n\r\n```html {title=\"layouts/partials/head.html\", linenostart=15}\r\n\u003clink rel=\"shortcut icon\" href=\"icon.png\" type=\"image/png\"\u003e\r\n```\r\n\r\nThe default can be overridden by defining a value to the `favicon` key in your \r\n`data/config.yaml` file. For example, here is a `List[Dictionary]` example format, which is\r\nequivalent to the default:\r\n\r\n```yaml {title=\"data/config.yaml\", linenos=false}\r\nfavicon:\r\n  - { rel: \"shortcut icon\", href: \"icon.png\", type: \"image/png\" }\r\n#  - { ... } # Repeat for each additional favicon you want to add\r\n```\r\n\r\nIn this format, the keys are identical to their HTML representations.\r\n\r\nIf you plan to add multiple favicons generated by a website (see list below), it\r\nmay be easier to define it as HTML. Here is an example which appends the \r\n**Apple touch icon** to Quartz's default favicon:\r\n\r\n```yaml {title=\"data/config.yaml\", linenos=false}\r\nfavicon: |\r\n  \u003clink rel=\"shortcut icon\" href=\"icon.png\" type=\"image/png\"\u003e\r\n  \u003clink rel=\"apple-touch-icon\" sizes=\"180x180\" href=\"/apple-touch-icon.png\"\u003e\r\n```\r\n\r\nThis second favicon will now be used as a web page icon when someone adds your \r\nwebpage to the home screen of their Apple device. If you are interested in more \r\ninformation about the current and past standards of favicons, you can read \r\n[this article](https://www.emergeinteractive.com/insights/detail/the-essentials-of-favicons/).\r\n\r\n**Note** that all generated favicon paths, defined by the `href` \r\nattribute, are relative to the `static/` directory.\r\n\r\n### Graph View\r\nTo customize the Interactive Graph view, you can poke around `data/graphConfig.yaml`.\r\n\r\n```yaml {title=\"data/graphConfig.yaml\"}\r\n# if true, a Global Graph will be shown on home page with full width, no backlink.\r\n# A different set of Local Graphs will be shown on sub pages.\r\n# if false, Local Graph will be default on every page as usual\r\nenableGlobalGraph: false\r\n\r\n### Local Graph ###\r\nlocalGraph:\r\n    # whether automatically generate a legend\r\n    enableLegend: false\r\n    \r\n    # whether to allow dragging nodes in the graph\r\n    enableDrag: true\r\n    \r\n    # whether to allow zooming and panning the graph\r\n    enableZoom: true\r\n    \r\n    # how many neighbours of the current node to show (-1 is all nodes)\r\n    depth: 1\r\n    \r\n    # initial zoom factor of the graph\r\n    scale: 1.2\r\n    \r\n    # how strongly nodes should repel each other\r\n    repelForce: 2\r\n\r\n    # how strongly should nodes be attracted to the center of gravity\r\n    centerForce: 1\r\n\r\n    # what the default link length should be\r\n    linkDistance: 1\r\n    \r\n    # how big the node labels should be\r\n    fontSize: 0.6\r\n    \r\n    # scale at which to start fading the labes on nodes\r\n    opacityScale: 3\r\n\r\n### Global Graph ###\r\nglobalGraph:\r\n\t# same settings as above\r\n\r\n### For all graphs ###\r\n# colour specific nodes path off of their path\r\npaths:\r\n  - /moc: \"#4388cc\"\r\n```\r\n\r\n\r\n## Styling\r\nWant to go even more in-depth? You can add custom CSS styling and change existing colours through editing `assets/styles/custom.scss`. If you'd like to target specific parts of the site, you can add ids and classes to the HTML partials in `/layouts/partials`. \r\n\r\n### Partials\r\nPartials are what dictate what gets rendered to the page. Want to change how pages are styled and structured? You can edit the appropriate layout in `/layouts`.\r\n\r\nFor example, the structure of the home page can be edited through `/layouts/index.html`. To customize the footer, you can edit `/layouts/partials/footer.html`\r\n\r\nMore info about partials on [Hugo's website.](https://gohugo.io/templates/partials/)\r\n\r\nStill having problems? Checkout our [FAQ and Troubleshooting guide](notes/troubleshooting.md).\r\n\r\n## Language Support\r\n[CJK + Latex Support (ÊµãËØï)](notes/CJK%20+%20Latex%20Support%20(ÊµãËØï).md) comes out of the box with Quartz.\r\n\r\nWant to support languages that read from right-to-left (like Arabic)? Hugo (and by proxy, Quartz) supports this natively.\r\n\r\nFollow the steps [Hugo provides here](https://gohugo.io/content-management/multilingual/#configure-languages) and modify your `config.toml`\r\n\r\nFor example:\r\n\r\n```toml\r\ndefaultContentLanguage = 'ar'\r\n[languages]\r\n  [languages.ar]\r\n    languagedirection = 'rtl'\r\n    title = 'ŸÖÿØŸàŸÜÿ™Ÿä'\r\n    weight = 1\r\n```\r\n",

    "title": "Hosting with Docker",
    "content": "\r\nIf you want to host Quartz on a machine without using a webpage hosting service, it may be easier to [install Docker Compose](https://docs.docker.com/compose/install/) and follow the instructions below than to [install Quartz's dependencies manually](notes/preview%20changes.md).\r\n## Hosting Quartz Locally\r\nYou can serve Quartz locally at `http://localhost:1313` with the following script, replacing `/path/to/quartz` with the \r\nactual path to your Quartz folder.\r\n\r\ndocker-compose.yml\r\n```\r\nservices:\r\n  quartz-hugo:\r\n    image: ghcr.io/jackyzha0/quartz:hugo\r\n    container_name: quartz-hugo\r\n    volumes:\r\n      - /path/to/quartz:/quartz\r\n    ports:\r\n      - 1313:1313\r\n\r\n    # optional\r\n    environment:\r\n      - HUGO_BIND=0.0.0.0\r\n      - HUGO_BASEURL=http://localhost\r\n      - HUGO_PORT=1313\r\n      - HUGO_APPENDPORT=true\r\n      - HUGO_LIVERELOADPORT=-1\r\n```\r\n\r\nThen run with: `docker-compose up -d` in the same directory as your `docker-compose.yml` file.\r\n\r\nWhile the container is running, you can update the `quartz` fork with: `docker exec -it quartz-hugo make update`.\r\n\r\n## Exposing Your Container to the Internet\r\n\r\n### To Your Public IP Address with Port Forwarding (insecure)\r\n\r\nAssuming you are already familiar with [port forwarding](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Port_forwarding) and [setting it up with your router model](https://portforward.com):\r\n\r\n1. You should set the environment variable `HUGO_BASEURL=http://your-public-ip` and then start your container.\r\n2. Set up port forwarding on your router from port `p` to `your-local-ip:1313`.\r\n3. You should now be able to access Quartz from outside your local network at `http://your-public-ip:p`.\r\n\r\nHowever, your HTTP connection will be unencrypted and **this method is not secure**.\r\n\r\n### To a Domain using Cloudflare Proxy\r\n\r\n1. Port forward 443 (HTTPS) from your machine.\r\n2. Buy a custom domain (say, `your-domain.com`) from [Cloudflare](https://www.cloudflare.com/products/registrar/). Point a DNS A record from `your-domain.com` to your public IP address and enable the proxy.\r\n3. Set the environment variables `HUGO_BASEURL=https://your-domain.com`, `HUGO_PORT=443`, and `HUGO_APPENDPORT=false`. Change `1313:1313` to `443:443` for the `ports` in `docker-compose.yml`.\r\n4. Spin up your Quartz container and enjoy it at `https://your-domain.com`!\r\n\r\n### To a Domain using a Reverse Proxy\r\n\r\nIf you want to serve more than just Quartz to the internet on this machine (or don't want to use the Cloudflare registrar and proxy), you should follow the steps in the section above (as appropriate) and also set up a reverse proxy, like [Traefik](https://doc.traefik.io/traefik). Be sure to configure your TLS certificates too!\r\n",

    "content": "\r\n## Hosting on GitHub Pages\r\nQuartz is designed to be effortless to deploy. If you forked and cloned Quartz directly from the repository, everything should already be good to go! Follow the steps below.\r\n\r\n### Enable GitHub Actions Permissions\r\nBy default, GitHub disables workflows from modifying your files (for good reason!). However, Quartz needs this to write the actual site files back to GitHub.\r\n\r\nHead to `Settings \u003e Action \u003e General \u003e Workflow Permissions` and choose `Read and Write Permissions`\r\n\r\n![[notes/images/github-actions.png]]\r\n*Enable GitHub Actions*\r\n\r\n### Enable GitHub Pages\r\n\r\nHead to the 'Settings' tab of your forked repository and go to the 'Pages' tab.\r\n\r\n1. (IMPORTANT) Set the source to deploy from `master` (and not `hugo`) using `/ (root)`\r\n2. Set a custom domain here if you have one!\r\n\r\n![Enable GitHub Pages](/notes/images/github-pages.png)*Enable GitHub Pages*\r\n\r\n### Pushing Changes\r\nTo see your changes on the internet, we need to push it them to GitHub. Quartz is a `git` repository so updating it is the same workflow as you would follow as if it were just a regular software project.\r\n\r\n```shell\r\n# Navigate to Quartz folder\r\ncd \u003cpath-to-quartz\u003e\r\n\r\n# Commit all changes\r\ngit add .\r\ngit commit -m \"message describing changes\"\r\n\r\n# Push to GitHub to update site\r\ngit push origin hugo\r\n```\r\n\r\nNote: we specifically push to the `hugo` branch here. Our GitHub action automatically runs everytime a push to is detected to that branch and then updates the `master` branch for redeployment.\r\n\r\n### Setting up the Site\r\nNow let's get this site up and running. Never hosted a site before? No problem. Have a fancy custom domain you already own or want to subdomain your Quartz? That's easy too.\r\n\r\nHere, we take advantage of GitHub's free page hosting to deploy our site. Change `baseURL` in `/config.toml`. \r\n\r\nMake sure that your `baseURL` has a trailing `/`!\r\n\r\n[Reference `config.toml` here](https://github.com/jackyzha0/quartz/blob/hugo/config.toml)\r\n\r\n```toml\r\nbaseURL = \"https://\u003cYOUR-DOMAIN\u003e/\"\r\n```\r\n\r\nIf you are using this under a subdomain (e.g. `\u003cYOUR-GITHUB-USERNAME\u003e.github.io/quartz`), include the trailing `/`. **You need to do this especially if you are using GitHub!**\r\n\r\n```toml\r\nbaseURL = \"https://\u003cYOUR-GITHUB-USERNAME\u003e.github.io/quartz/\"\r\n```\r\n\r\nChange `cname` in `/.github/workflows/deploy.yaml`. Again, if you don't have a custom domain to use, you can use `\u003cYOUR-USERNAME\u003e.github.io`.\r\n\r\nPlease note that the `cname` field should *not* have any path `e.g. end with /quartz` or have a trailing `/`.\r\n\r\n[Reference `deploy.yaml` here](https://github.com/jackyzha0/quartz/blob/hugo/.github/workflows/deploy.yaml)\r\n\r\n```yaml {title=\".github/workflows/deploy.yaml\"}\r\n- name: Deploy  \r\n  uses: peaceiris/actions-gh-pages@v3  \r\n  with:  \r\n\tgithub_token: ${{ secrets.GITHUB_TOKEN }} # this can stay as is, GitHub fills this in for us!\r\n\tpublish_dir: ./public  \r\n\tpublish_branch: master\r\n\tcname: \u003cYOUR-DOMAIN\u003e\r\n```\r\n\r\nHave a custom domain?

There are an overwhelming number of tutorials, resources, and guides for tools like [Notion](https://www.notion.so/), [Roam](https://roamresearch.com/), and [Obsidian](https://obsidian.md/), yet none of them have super easy to use *free* tools to publish that garden to the world.\r\n\r\nI've personally found that\r\n1.

Ensure you have [Go](https://golang.org/doc/install) (\u003e= 1.16) installed.\r\n\r\n```bash\r\n# Install and link `hugo-obsidian` locally\r\ngo install github.com/jackyzha0/hugo-obsidian@latest\r\n```\r\n\r\nIf you are running into an error saying that `command not found: hugo-obsidian`, make sure you set your `GOPATH` correctly (see [[notes/troubleshooting#`command not found: hugo-obsidian`|the troubleshooting page]])! This will allow your terminal to correctly recognize hugo-obsidian as an executable.\r\n\r\n##  Installing Hugo\r\nHugo is the static site generator that powers Quartz. [Install Hugo with \"extended\" Sass/SCSS version](https://gohugo.io/getting-started/installing/) first. Then,\r\n\r\n```bash\r\n# Navigate to your local Quartz folder\r\ncd \u003clocation-of-your-local-quartz\u003e\r\n\r\n# Start local server\r\nmake serve\r\n\r\n# View your site in a browser at http://localhost:1313/\r\n```\r\n\r\n\u003e [!INFO] Docker Support\r\n\u003e\r\n\u003e If you have the Docker CLI installed already, you can avoid installing `hugo-obsidian` and `hugo`.

  "/notes/search": {
    "title": "Search",
    "content": "\r\nQuartz supports two modes of searching through content.\r\n\r\n## Full-text\r\nFull-text search is the default in Quartz. It produces results that *exactly* match the search query. This is easier to setup but usually produces lower quality matches.\r\n\r\n```yaml {title=\"data/config.yaml\"}\r\n# the default option\r\nenableSemanticSearch: false\r\n```\r\n\r\n## Natural Language\r\nNatural language search is powered by [Operand](https://beta.operand.ai/). It understands language like a person does and finds results that best match user intent. In this sense, it is closer to how Google Search works.\r\n\r\nNatural language search tends to produce higher quality results than full-text search.\r\n\r\nHere's how to set it up.\r\n\r\n1. Login or Register for a new Operand account. Click the verification link sent to your email, and you'll be redirected to the dashboard. (Note) You do not need to enter a credit card to create an account, or get started with the Operand API. The first $10 of usage each month is free. To learn more, see pricing. If you go over your free quota, we'll (politely) reach out and ask you to configure billing.\r\n2. Create your first index. On the dashboard, under \"Indexes\", enter the name and description of your index, and click \"Create Index\". Note down the ID of the index (obtained by clicking on the index name in the list of indexes), as you'll need it in the next step. IDs are unique to each index, and look something like `uqv1duxxbdxu`.\r\n3. Click into the index you've created. Under \"Index Something\", select \"SITEMAP\" from the dropdown and click \"Add Source\".\r\n4. For the \"Sitemap.xml URL\", put your deployed site's base URL followed by `sitemap.xml`. For example, for `quartz.jzhao.xyz`, put `https://quartz.jzhao.xyz/sitemap.xml`. Leave the URL Regex empty. \r\n5. Get your API key. On the dashboard, under \"API Keys\", you can manage your API keys. If you don't already have an API key, click \"Create API Key\". You'll need this for the next step.\r\n6. Open `data/config.yaml`. Set `enableSemanticSearch` to `true`, `operandApiKey` to your copied key, and `operandIndexId` to the ID of the index we created from earlier..\r\n\r\n```yaml {title=\"data/config.yaml\"}\r\n# the default option\r\nsearch:\r\n  enableSemanticSearch: true\r\n  operandApiKey: \"jp9k5hudse2a828z98kxd6z3payi8u90rnjf\"\r\n  operandIndexId: \"s0kf3bd6tldw\"\r\n```\r\n7. Push your changes to the site and wait for it to deploy.\r\n8. Check the Operand dashboard and wait for your site to index. Enjoy natural language search powered by Operand!\r\n",

    "title": "Troubleshooting and FAQ",
    "content": "\r\nStill having trouble? Here are a list of common questions and problems people encounter when installing Quartz.\r\n\r\nWhile you're here, join our [Discord](https://discord.gg/cRFFHYye7t) :)\r\n\r\n### Does Quartz have Latex support?\r\nYes! See [CJK + Latex Support (ÊµãËØï)](notes/CJK%20+%20Latex%20Support%20(ÊµãËØï).md) for a brief demo.\r\n\r\n### Can I use \\\u003cObsidian Plugin\\\u003e in Quartz?\r\nUnless it produces direct Markdown output in the file, no. There currently is no way to bundle plugin code with Quartz.\r\n\r\nThe easiest way would be to add your own HTML partial that supports the functionality you are looking for.\r\n\r\n### My GitHub pages is just showing the README and not Quartz\r\nMake sure you set the source to deploy from `master` (and not `hugo`) using `/ (root)`! See more in the [hosting](/notes/hosting) guide\r\n\r\n### Some of my pages have 'January 1, 0001' as the last modified date\r\nThis is a problem caused by `git` treating files as case-insensitive by default and some of your posts probably have capitalized file names. You can turn this off in your Quartz by running this command.\r\n\r\n```shell\r\n# in the root of your Quartz (same folder as config.toml)\r\ngit config core.ignorecase true\r\n\r\n# or globally (not recommended)\r\ngit config --global core.ignorecase true\r\n```\r\n\r\n### Can I publish only a subset of my pages?\r\nYes! Quartz makes selective publishing really easy. Heres a guide on [excluding pages from being published](notes/ignore%20notes.md).\r\n\r\n### Can I host this myself and not on GitHub Pages?\r\nYes! All built files can be found under `/public` in the `master` branch. More details under [hosting](notes/hosting.md).\r\n\r\n### `command not found: hugo-obsidian`\r\nMake sure you set your `GOPATH` correctly! This will allow your terminal to correctly recognize `hugo-obsidian` as an executable.\r\n\r\n```shell\r\n# Add the following 2 lines to your ~/.bash_profile (~/.zshrc if you are on Mac)\r\nexport GOPATH=/Users/$USER/go\r\nexport PATH=$GOPATH/bin:$PATH\r\n\r\n# In your current terminal, to reload the session\r\nsource ~/.bash_profile # again, (~/.zshrc if you are on Mac)\r\n```\r\n\r\n### How come my notes aren't being rendered?\r\nYou probably forgot to include front matter in your Markdown files. You can either setup [Obsidian](notes/obsidian.md) to do this for you or you need to manually define it. More details in [the 'how to edit' guide](notes/editing.md).\r\n\r\n### My custom domain isn't working!\r\nWalk through the steps in [the hosting guide](notes/hosting.md) again. Make sure you wait 30 min to 1 hour for changes to take effect.\r\n\r\n### How do I setup analytics?\r\nQuartz by default uses [Plausible](https://plausible.io/) for analytics. \r\n\r\nIf you would prefer to use Google Analytics, you can follow this [guide in the Hugo documentation](https://gohugo.io/templates/internal/#google-analytics). \r\n\r\nAlternatively, you can also import your Google Analytics data into Plausible by [following this guide](https://plausible.io/docs/google-analytics-import).\r\n\r\n\r\n### How do I change the content on the home page?\r\nTo edit the main home page, open `/content/_index.md`.\r\n\r\n### How do I change the colours?\r\nYou can change the theme by editing `assets/custom.scss`. More details on customization and themeing can be found in the [customization guide](notes/config.md).\r\n\r\n### How do I add images?\r\nYou can put images anywhere in the `/content` folder.\r\n\r\n```markdown\r\nExample image (source is in content/notes/images/example.png)\r\n![Example Image](/content/notes/images/example.png)\r\n```\r\n\r\n### My Interactive Graph and Backlinks aren't up to date\r\nBy default, the `linkIndex.json` (which Quartz needs to generate the Interactive Graph and Backlinks) are not regenerated locally. To set that up, see the guide on [local editing](notes/editing.md)\r\n\r\n### Can I use React/Vue/some other framework?\r\nNot out of the box. You could probably make it work by editing `/layouts/_default/single.html` but that's not what Quartz is designed to work with. 99% of things you are trying to do with those frameworks you can accomplish perfectly fine using just vanilla HTML/CSS/JS.\r\n\r\n## Still Stuck?\r\nQuartz isn't perfect! If you're still having troubles, file an issue in the GitHub repo with as much information as you can reasonably provide. Alternatively, you can message me on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/_jzhao) and I'll try to get back to you as soon as I can.\r\n\r\nüêõ [Submit an Issue](https://github.com/jackyzha0/quartz/issues)\r\n",
