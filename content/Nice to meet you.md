I am Naman, I build things.

That's what I do. That's what I'm always curious about. That's what's authentic to me.

Everyday I wake up, I want to build something. 
That's how I want to look at life.
I enjoy it. I love it alone. It's 10 fold better as a collaboration.

I know others look at life differently. Let them do that. I'll do me. 

Career wise, here's what I genuinely want to do. afaik.
- Experiment with tech - learn about the cutting edge in tech - in the context of how it can be applied to different fields.
- Build products, experiences and processes
	- and have someone else execute them, maybe?
		- They can give me feedback and we can refine it together. But I feel someone else can execute things better than I can. 
		- My core value is in bringing loads of information and my understanding together into useful functional contextual chunks
- Teach people - help people
	- I want to do everything to empower people, especially ones who might be slightly less privileged than me, to give them the tools, information and understanding they need to conquer and gain freedom in today's abundant digital world.


This would mean - I also need to keep learning and exposing myself to different fields. 
As that is the core competency of an inventor. To put together diverse fields - you need to learn about them deeply first. 

Learning needs to be a core part of my weekly hour split.
