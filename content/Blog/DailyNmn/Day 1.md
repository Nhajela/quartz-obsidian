Today morning was a good morning. Though I wish I woke up a bit earlier, this was a good morning. I went downstairs, met Amey, talked to him for a while. That was all I needed to start my day with a positive note.

Kinda reminds you of what is the best experience in life, to experience it with other people. That's what gives life color and meaning, other people. 

'Community' haha! 

As I was living basically on my own for the last 3 months, and have been living on my own for basically the last 2 years, this purpose meaning thing gets a bit fuzzy.

I read in Rinkesh's substack blog somewhere, 
Going out and chatting with friends is the solution to existentialism.  And I totally believe it, it brings you out of your zone, gives you perspective and makes life a little lighter. 
Especially as you see everyone around you being a little imperfect, but totally beautiful in their own way. 

There's no wrong or right with people, all of us want the same things :)
