title: "Daily Nmn"

So, from today - 26 July, I start Project Naman. 

Project Naman is a new endeavor that I always wanted to do, in the spirit of actively improving myself and grow in various aspects of my life.

Health, wealth and relationships. 

For the same, each week, I will be undertaking small challenges that will push me out of my comfort zone and help me develop new skills and habits.

The first challenge that I have set for myself in Project Naman is to write daily. Writing has always been a passion of mine, but I often can't keep up with the consistency. 

Yet, i think for all projects within project Naman, writing is a foundational one. We will only know how they go, if we slow down, write and reflect about them. And that's why this is the first project.

I shall write everyday, ideally for the rest of my life from now on.
