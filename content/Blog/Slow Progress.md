I was listening to [SCB](https://open.spotify.com/show/70tDlUjoCZAFqO7cnuspJW) and it talked about how most important things in life come from consistency and not some breakthrough. 

That's similar to the challenge that I've started today. From today onwards, I shall be doing weekly challenges. 

My 'why' behind doing them is that I want to show all the other youth in India that you can make it, that they don't need to worry and all they need to do is work hard in the right direction, towards the right opportunities and they can build a beautiful life for themselves. 

I want to do this by documenting my entire journey through this, as I navigate the last year of college and build a career and a happy life for myself. 

I want to show them that if I can do this, then they can take inspiration from the same fundamentals and do this too :) 


I'll be working with Amey on the YouTube side of things for this. I'm super excited to get started, I've started recording the first video already. 

The plan is, and I commit to this, that we shall make a video every week for the next 1 year atleast. 

It takes me back to what Ankur %% #AnkurWarikoo %% used to say, you build trust by showing up everyday. So that's what we're going to do too. 

Alright then, I'm off to work now. Have a great day ahead :)
