### Podcasts: 

- [Woice with Warikoo](https://open.spotify.com/show/1g7wpoqydK6hszvi4DFywg)
	- There's just something reassuring about hearing Ankur's voice everyday in the morning. It fills you up with hope and brightness :) 
- [The Stoic Coffee Break](https://open.spotify.com/show/70tDlUjoCZAFqO7cnuspJW)
	- Lovely music, lovely voice and lovely topics being talked about. I like this podcast more than the daily stoic podcast. It gives you something to think about or reminds you of something important that you might not have revisited in a while :))
