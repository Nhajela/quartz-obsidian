23 June '23

Over the last year, I've been struggling with bad mental health, self doubt and what not. 

Today was intense, I must've spent more than half of the way doomscrolling.

I was going to call Kabir (who's starting a new agency) and tell him that I won't be participating in it as much, since I really want to focus on my mental health now. I was feeling low on energy and low on the will to do anything

But then he called me and told me that he signed the client that I was needed to manage. This was like an opportunity, call to rise up. 
I'm like, okay, I need to do this and the only way I'm gonna do this is if I take things in my control.

So, the rest of the day, I've slowly reclaimed control of my mind. 
Right now, before sleeping. I feel much better, normal and hopeful.

Work gives me energy. 

I hope to build on this momentum and work to both fix my mental health and do crazy amazing work. 

I want to be crazy, I want to obsess and work.

I want to be crazy with the people around me, to tell them that I love them. 

May god be with me, and may I help myself through this journey.

> It is all in your mind, remember that!



Have a great day ahead!
