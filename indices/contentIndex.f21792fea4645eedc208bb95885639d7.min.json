Over the last 3 years, I have been blessed to have had experiences and exposure that gave me the awareness to move ahead with today. \n\nSo, from today - 26 July, I start Project Naman. \n\nProject Naman is a new endeavor that I always wanted to do, in the spirit of actively improving myself and grow in various aspects of my life.\n\nHealth, wealth and relationships. \n\nFor the same, each week, I will be undertaking small challenges that will push me out of my comfort zone and help me develop new skills and habits.\n\nThe first challenge that I have set for myself in Project Naman is to write daily. Writing has always been a passion of mine, but I often can't keep up with the consistency. \n\nYet, i think for all projects within project Naman, writing is a foundational one. We will only know how they go, if we slow down, write and reflect about them. And that's why this is the first project.\n\nI shall write everyday, ideally for the rest of my life from now on.\n\n\nHere's the latest note [[Blog/DailyNmn/Day 1|Day 1]]\n\n","lastmodified":"2023-07-26T04:19:59.481408349Z","tags":[]},"/Blog/DailyNmn/":{"title":"_index","content":"So, from today - 26 July, I start Project Naman. \n\nProject Naman is a new endeavor that I always wanted to do, in the spirit of actively improving myself and grow in various aspects of my life.\n\nHealth, wealth and relationships. \n\nFor the same, each week, I will be undertaking small challenges that will push me out of my comfort zone and help me develop new skills and habits.\n\nThe first challenge that I have set for myself in Project Naman is to write daily.

Though I wish I woke up a bit earlier, this was a good morning. I went downstairs, met Amey, talked to him for a while. That was all I needed to start my day with a positive note.\n\nKinda reminds you of what is the best experience in life, to experience it with other people. That's what gives life color and meaning, other people. \n\n'Community' haha! \n\nAs I was living basically on my own for the last 3 months, and have been living on my own for basically the last 2 years, this purpose meaning thing gets a bit fuzzy.\n\nI read in Rinkesh's substack blog somewhere, \nGoing out and chatting with friends is the solution to existentialism.  And I totally believe it, it brings you out of your zone, gives you perspective and makes life a little lighter. \nEspecially as you see everyone around you being a little imperfect, but totally beautiful in their own way. \n\nThere's no wrong or right with people, all of us want the same things :) \n","lastmodified":"2023-07-26T04:19:59.481408349Z","tags":["DailyNmn (#dailynmn)"]},"/Blog/Slow-Progress":{"title":"Slow Progress","content":"\n\nI was listening to [SCB](https://open.spotify.com/show/70tDlUjoCZAFqO7cnuspJW) and it talked about how most important things in life come from consistency and not some breakthrough. \n\nThat's similar to the challenge that I've started today. From today onwards, I shall be doing weekly challenges. \n\nMy 'why' behind doing them is that I want to show all the other youth in India that you can make it, that they don't need to worry and all they need to do is work hard in the right direction, towards the right opportunities and they can build a beautiful life for themselves. \n\nI want to do this by documenting my entire journey through this, as I navigate the last year of college and build a career and a happy life for myself. \n\nI want to show them that if I can do this, then they can take inspiration from the same fundamentals and do this too :) \n\n\nI'll be working with Amey on the YouTube side of things for this. I'm super excited to get started, I've started recording the first video already. \n\nThe plan is, and I commit to this, that we shall make a video every week for the next 1 year atleast. \n\nIt takes me back to what Ankur %% #AnkurWarikoo %% used to say, you build trust by showing up everyday. So that's what we're going to do too. \n\nAlright then, I'm off to work now. Have a great day ahead :)\n\n\nDate: 24-07-23","lastmodified":"2023-07-26T04:19:59.481408349Z","tags":["Consistency","ProjectNaman","StoicCoffeeBreak"]},"/Nice-to-meet-you":{"title":"Nice to meet you","content":"\nI am Naman, I build things.\n\nThat's what I do. That's what I'm always curious about. That's what's authentic to me.\n\nEveryday I wake up, I want to build something. \nThat's how I want to look at life.\nI enjoy it. I love it alone. It's 10 fold better as a collaboration.\n\nI know others look at life differently. Let them do that. I'll do me. \n\nCareer wise, here's what I genuinely want to do. afaik.\n- Experiment with tech - learn about the cutting edge in tech - in the context of how it can be applied to different fields.\n- Build products, experiences and processes\n\t- and have someone else execute them, maybe?\n\t\t- They can give me feedback and we can refine it together. But I feel someone else can execute things better than I can. \n\t\t- My core value is in bringing loads of information and my understanding together into useful functional contextual chunks\n- Teach people - help people\n\t- I want to do everything to empower people, especially ones who might be slightly less privileged than me, to give them the tools, information and understanding they need to conquer and gain freedom in today's abundant digital world.\n\t- Varun Mayya's 'unfair advantage thing inspires me', I want to be the unfair advantage for all these people :) \n\n\nThis would mean - I also need to keep learning and exposing myself to different fields. \nAs that is the core competency of an inventor. To put together diverse fields - you need to learn about them deeply first. \n\nLearning needs to be a core part of my weekly hour split. \n\n-------\n\nThis page and all others will keep updating as I grow!\nHere's to documenting my entire journey in public. \n\n\nCheers! \nnmn","lastmodified":"2023-07-26T04:19:59.481408349Z","tags":[]},"/nmn/Reccomendations":{"title":"Reccomendations","content":"\n### Podcasts: \n\n- [Woice with Warikoo](https://open.spotify.com/show/1g7wpoqydK6hszvi4DFywg)\n\t- There's just something reassuring about hearing Ankur's voice everyday in the morning.

I like this podcast more than the daily stoic podcast.
