From today onwards, I shall be doing weekly challenges. \n\nMy 'why' behind doing them is that I want to show all the other youth in India that you can make it, that they don't need to worry and all they need to do is work hard in the right direction, towards the right opportunities and they can build a beautiful life for themselves. \n\nI want to do this by documenting my entire journey through this, as I navigate the last year of college and build a career and a happy life for myself. \n\nI want to show them that if I can do this, then they can take inspiration from the same fundamentals and do this too :) \n\n\nI'll be working with Amey on the YouTube side of things for this. I'm super excited to get started, I've started recording the first video already. \n\nThe plan is, and I commit to this, that we shall make a video every week for the next 1 year atleast. \n\nIt takes me back to what Ankur %% #AnkurWarikoo %% used to say, you build trust by showing up everyday. So that's what we're going to do too. \n\nAlright then, I'm off to work now. Have a great day ahead :)\n\n\nDate: 24-07-23","lastmodified":"2023-07-24T03:06:37.466809635Z","tags":["Consistency","ProjectNaman","StoicCoffeeBreak"]},"/Nice-to-meet-you":{"title":"Nice to meet you","content":"\nI am Naman, I build things.\n\nThat's what I do. That's what I'm always curious about. That's what's authentic to me.\n\nEveryday I wake up, I want to build something. \nThat's how I want to look at life.\nI enjoy it. I love it alone. It's 10 fold better as a collaboration.\n\nI know others look at life differently. Let them do that. I'll do me. \n\nCareer wise, here's what I genuinely want to do. afaik.\n- Experiment with tech - learn about the cutting edge in tech - in the context of how it can be applied to different fields.\n- Build products, experiences and processes\n\t- and have someone else execute them, maybe?\n\t\t- They can give me feedback and we can refine it together. But I feel someone else can execute things better than I can. \n\t\t- My core value is in bringing loads of information and my understanding together into useful functional contextual chunks\n- Teach people - help people\n\t- I want to do everything to empower people, especially ones who might be slightly less privileged than me, to give them the tools, information and understanding they need to conquer and gain freedom in today's abundant digital world.\n\t- Varun Mayya's 'unfair advantage thing inspires me', I want to be the unfair advantage for all these people :) \n\n\nThis would mean - I also need to keep learning and exposing myself to different fields. \nAs that is the core competency of an inventor. To put together diverse fields - you need to learn about them deeply first. \n\nLearning needs to be a core part of my weekly hour split. \n\n-------\n\nThis page and all others will keep updating as I grow!\nHere's to documenting my entire journey in public. \n\n\nCheers! \nnmn","lastmodified":"2023-07-24T03:06:37.466809635Z","tags":[]},"/nmn/Reccomendations":{"title":"Reccomendations","content":"\n### Podcasts: \n\n- [Woice with Warikoo](https://open.spotify.com/show/1g7wpoqydK6hszvi4DFywg)\n\t- There's just something reassuring about hearing Ankur's voice everyday in the morning. It fills you up with hope and brightness :) \n- [The Stoic Coffee Break](https://open.spotify.com/show/70tDlUjoCZAFqO7cnuspJW)\n\t- Lovely music, lovely voice and lovely topics being talked about. I like this podcast more than the daily stoic podcast. It gives you something to think about or reminds you of something important that you might not have revisited in a while :)) \n","lastmodified":"2023-07-24T03:06:37.466809635Z","tags":[]},"/notes/I-would-like-to-thank":{"title":"I would like to thank","content":"\nAnurag\nAmey\nSavnoi","lastmodified":"2023-07-24T03:06:37.466809635Z","tags":[]}}
